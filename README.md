# Redis as a Message Queue (MQ)

Redis can serve as a high-performance message queue solution in addition to its caching capabilities. By leveraging Redis as a message broker, you can avoid introducing additional technology into your application stack while benefiting from its speed and reliability.

## Cloning the Repository

To clone this repository, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
3. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

   Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of the repository.

4. Once the repository is cloned, navigate into the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd <project_directory>
    ```

   Replace `<project_directory>` with the name of the directory created by the cloning process.

## Running the Code Base

To run the code base, make sure you have the necessary prerequisites installed and configured. These may include:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Maven (for building the project)
- Redis Server (for the Redis message broker)

Once you have the prerequisites installed, follow these steps:

1. Start the Redis server if it's not already running. You can usually start it by running:

    ```bash
    redis-server
    ```

2. Build the project using Maven. Navigate to the project directory containing the `pom.xml` file and run:

    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

3. Once the project is built successfully, you can run it using the following command:

    ```bash
    java -jar target/<jar_file_name>.jar
    ```

   Replace `<jar_file_name>` with the name of the generated JAR file.

4. The application should now be up and running, and you can interact with it as needed.
